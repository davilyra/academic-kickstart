[Introductory MATLAB Course](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TN2yufZAJZxL6Zp8JGUZTJj4o0wOo4Hz/view?usp=sharing) (in Portuguese) class material of the course ministered at the University of Bras√≠lia, for the IEEE UnB Student Branch in June 2012.

[Tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nB_VV52cm1gfrWnKeZ1dcEAko4ZWTz4V/view?usp=sharing) on how to work with [DICOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) and [TAG](http://www.tomovision.com/products/sliceomatic.html) files using [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

  * Function [tagread](https://github.com/davilyra/simple-Matlab-functions/blob/master/dicom_tag/tagread.m) used to read *.tag files;
  * Function [dicomsort](https://github.com/davilyra/simple-Matlab-functions/blob/master/dicom_tag/dicomsort.m) used to read and sort a stack of multiple DICOM files.
