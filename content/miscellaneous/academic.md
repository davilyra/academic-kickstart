[Introductory MATLAB Course](/static/pdf/lyraleite_sbieeeunb_matlab_2012.pdf) (in Portuguese) class material of the course ministered at the University of Bras√≠lia, for the IEEE UnB Student Branch in June 2012.
Acknowledgements: Professors [Marcus Chaffim](https://fga.unb.br/marcus.chaffim) and [Alexandre Zaghetto](http://alexandre.zaghetto.com), from whom I borrowed the majority of the examples provided in the slides.


[Tutorial](static/pdf/lyraleite_dicomtag_matlab_tutorial.pdf) on how to work with [DICOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) and [TAG](http://www.tomovision.com/products/sliceomatic.html) files using [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

  * Function [tagread](https://github.com/davilyra/simple-Matlab-functions/blob/master/dicom_tag/tagread.m) used to read *.tag files;
  * Function [dicomsort](https://github.com/davilyra/simple-Matlab-functions/blob/master/dicom_tag/dicomsort.m) used to read and sort a stack of multiple DICOM files.
