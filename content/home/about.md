# Biography

My name is Davi Lyra-Leite, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine](https://labs.feinberg.northwestern.edu/burridge/), working under the supervision of Professor [Paul Burridge](https://www.pharm.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile.html?xid=32270). My research focus on the development of cost-effective methods for cardiac differentiation and maturation, studying the metabolic regulators for hiPSC fate in the cardiac context, and the understanding of mechanisms behind cardiotoxicity due to anticancer therapies. I am also a senior researcher at [Instituto Mercado Popular](http://mercadopopular.org), a Brazilian think tank, where I work on healthcare policy.

I received my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.usc.edu) at the [University of Southern California](http://usc.edu). There I was a researcher with the [Laboratory for Living Systems Engineering](http://livingsystemsengineering.usc.edu), working under Professor [Megan McCain](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Mc-Cain/Megan), studying the extracellular matrix regulation of mitochondrial function and structure in cardiomyocytes.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Brasília](http://unb.br) (UnB, Brazil) in July 2012, a Master of Sciences in [Electrical Engineering](https://minghsiehee.usc.edu/academics/ms/) from USC in August 2017, and a [Health, Technology and Engineering](http://hte.usc.edu) graduate certificate in May 2019. At UnB, I conducted my research at the Digital Signal Processing Group and at the [Medical Imaging and Signal Processing Group](http://www2.ene.unb.br/joaoluiz/). I worked under supervision of Professors [João Luiz Carvalho](http://www2.ene.unb.br/joaoluiz/) and [Ricardo Lopes de Queiroz](http://queiroz.divp.org). Additionally, from August 2012 to May 2014, I worked under supervision of Professor [Krishna Nayak](http://sipi.usc.edu/~knayak/) at USC on projects related to MR image formation and analysis for disease characterization, complemented with a summer internship at [Toshiba Medical Research Institute USA](https://www.research.us.medical.canon/).
