# Biography

My name is Davi Lyra-Leite, I am a PhD candidate at the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.usc.edu) at the [University of Southern California](http://usc.edu) and researcher with the [Laboratory for Living Systems Engineering](http://livingsystemsengineering.usc.edu), working under Prof. [Megan McCain, PhD](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/McCain/Megan). I am also a [Health, Technology and Engineering](http://hte.usc.edu) student, a program that aims to foster collaboration between professionals between healthcare related fields and professionals to promote innovation. Lastly, I am a senior researcher at [Instituto Mercado Popular](http://mercadopopular.org), a Brazilian think tank, where I work on healthcare policy.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Brasília](http://unb.br) (UnB, Brazil) in July 2012, and a Master of Sciences in [Electrical Engineering](https://minghsiehee.usc.edu/academics/ms/) from USC in August 2017. At UnB, I conducted my research at the Digital Signal Processing Group and at the [Medical Imaging and Signal Processing Group](http://www2.ene.unb.br/joaoluiz/). I worked under supervision of Professors [João Luiz Carvalho](http://www2.ene.unb.br/joaoluiz/) and [Ricardo Lopes de Queiroz](http://queiroz.divp.org). Additionally, August 2012 to May 2014, I worked under supervision of Professor [Krishna Nayak](http://sipi.usc.edu/~knayak/) at USC on projects related to MR image formation and analysis for disease characterization, complemented with a summer internship at Toshiba Medical Research Institute USA.
