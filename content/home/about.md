# Biography

My name is Davi Lyra-Leite, I am a Principal Investigator at [Clever Carnivore](https://www.clevercarnivore.com) and [BMEM Bio](https://bmem.bio) working on cultivated meat, PSC technologies for growth and differentiation, and cellular engineering.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine](https://labs.feinberg.northwestern.edu/burridge/), working under the supervision of Professor [Paul Burridge](https://www.pharm.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile.html?xid=32270). My research focused on the development of cost-effective methods for cardiac differentiation and maturation, and the nutritional requirements of human pluripotent stem cells.

I received my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.usc.edu) at the [University of Southern California](http://usc.edu), working at the [Laboratory for Living Systems Engineering](http://livingsystemsengineering.usc.edu) under Professor [Megan McCain](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/McCain/Megan), studying the extracellular matrix regulation of mitochondrial function and structure in cardiomyocytes. Additionally, I hold a Master of Sciences in [Electrical Engineering](https://minghsiehee.usc.edu/academics/ms/) obtained in August 2017, and a [Health, Technology and Engineering](http://hte.usc.edu) graduate certificate in May 2019, both from USC. Lastly, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Brasília](http://unb.br) (UnB, Brazil) in July 2012.

I am also a volunteer senior researcher at [Instituto Mercado Popular](http://mercadopopular.org), a Brazilian think tank, working on healthcare policy.
