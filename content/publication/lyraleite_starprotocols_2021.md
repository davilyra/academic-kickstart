abstract = "The protocol provided here describes methodologies for making a highly cost-effective, chemically defined medium for culturing hiPSCs we call B8 medium. The typical cost of B8 medium is US$10 per liter, which with modifications included here is more affordable than standard media. We provide simple protocols for making B8 supplement aliquots, making the basal media DMEM/F12, Matrigel-coated plates, thawing, passaging, culturing, and cryopreserving hiPSCs. We show typical differentiation results and provide a comprehensive troubleshooting guide."
