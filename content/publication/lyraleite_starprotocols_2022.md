abstract = "The methods for the culture and cardiomyocyte differentiation of human embryonic stem cells, and later human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC), have moved from a complex and uncontrolled systems to simplified and relatively robust protocols, using the knowledge and cues gathered at each step. HiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes have proven to be a useful tool in human disease modelling, drug discovery, developmental biology, and regenerative medicine. In this protocol review, we will highlight the evolution of protocols associated with hPSC culture, cardiomyocyte differentiation, sub-type specification, and cardiomyocyte maturation. We also discuss protocols for somatic cell direct reprogramming to cardiomyocyte-like cells."
