abstract = "Purpose of Review: In this article, we review the different model systems based on human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and how they have been applied to identify the cardiotoxic effects of anticancer therapies. Recent Findings: Developments on 2D and 3D culture systems enabled the use of hiPSC-CMs as screening platforms for cardiotoxic effects of anticancer therapies such as anthracyclines, monoclonal antibodies, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Combined with computational approaches and higher throughput screening technologies, they have also enabled mechanistic studies and the search for cardioprotective strategies. Summary: As the population ages and cancer treatments become more effective, the cardiotoxic effects of anticancer drugs become a bigger problem leading to an increased role of cardio-oncology. In the past decade, human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have become an important platform for preclinical drug tests, elucidating mechanisms of action for drugs, and identifying cardioprotective pathways that could be further explored in the development of combined treatments. In this article, we highlight 2D and 3D model systems based on hiPSC-CMs that have been used to study the cardiotoxic effects of anticancer drugs, investigating their mechanisms of action and the potential for patient-specific prediction. We also present some of the important challenges and opportunities in the field, indicating possible future developments and how they could impact the landscape of cardio-oncology."
