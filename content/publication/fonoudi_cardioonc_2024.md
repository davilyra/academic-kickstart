abstract = "Background:
Genome-wide association studies and candidate gene association studies have identified more than 180 genetic variants statistically associated with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC). However, the lack of functional validation has hindered the clinical translation of these findings.
Objectives:
The aim of this study was to functionally validate all genes associated with AIC using human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs).
Methods:
Through a systemic literature search, 80 genes containing variants significantly associated with AIC were identified. Additionally, 3 more genes with potential roles in AIC (GSTM1, CBR1, and ERBB2) were included. Of these, 38 genes exhibited expression in human fetal heart, adult heart, and hiPSC-CMs. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9–based genome editing, each of these 38 genes was systematically knocked out in control hiPSC-CMs, and the resulting doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) phenotype was assessed using hiPSC-CMs. Subsequently, functional assays were conducted for each gene knockout on the basis of hypothesized mechanistic implications in DIC.
Results:
Knockout of 26 genes increased the susceptibility of hiPSC-CMs to DIC. Notable genes included efflux transporters (ABCC10, ABCC2, ABCB4, ABCC5, and ABCC9), well-established DIC-associated genes (CBR1, CBR3, and RAC2), and genome-wide association study–discovered genes (RARG and CELF4). Conversely, knockout of ATP2B1, HNMT, POR, CYBA, WDR4, and COL1A2 had no significant effect on the in vitro DIC phenotype of hiPSC-CMs. Furthermore, knockout of the uptake transporters (SLC28A3, SLC22A17, and SLC28A1) demonstrated a protective effect against DIC.
Conclusions:
The present findings establish a comprehensive platform for the functional validation of DIC-associated genes, providing insights for future studies in DIC variant associations and potential mechanistic targets for the development of cardioprotective drugs."
