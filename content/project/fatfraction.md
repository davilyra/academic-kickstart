From August 2012 to May 2014, my research focus was on image analysis aiming the development of automated tools for non-rigid intra-subject volume registration and segmentation from MR images, and phenotype classification based on abdominal fat. In this project, I worked with professors [Krishna Nayak](http://sipi.usc.edu/~knayak/), [Harry Hu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Houchun_Hu), [Anand Joshi](http://sipi.usc.edu/~ajoshi/), and [Michael Goran](http://www.goranlab.com). For more information about this topic, read the paper *[Automatic intra-subject registration-based segmentation of abdominal fat from three-dimensional waterâ€“fat MRI*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmri.23813), from Dr. Joshi, Dr. Hu et al.
