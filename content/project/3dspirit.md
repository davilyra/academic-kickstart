From August 2012 to May 2014, I worked on the development of image formation algorithms using [non-Cartesian parallel imaging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3304997/) applied to temporal-accelerated spiral Fourier velocity encoded (FVE) MRI as a follow up of my undergraduate thesis. This project was collaboration between professors Krishna Nayak, Joao Luiz Carvalho, and [Taehoon Shin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Taehoon_Shin). These results were presented at the [21st ISMRM Annual Meeting and Exhibition](https://www.ismrm.org/13/), in 2013.
