From April 2009 until September 2010, I worked under supervision of [Professor Ricardo de Queiroz](http://queiroz.divp.org), co-oriented by [Professor Díbio Leandro Borges](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dibio_Borges) and [Professor Camilo Chang Dorea](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7370796774582075), on the study of color constancy and calibration between color devices using a commercial camera as calibrative device. I also implemented an image scene classification (indoor vs outdoor) algorithm using machine learning. The results were presented at 7th DF’s Scientific Initiation Congress and at the Workshop de Pós-graduação do CIC (UnB).
